Title: Development and Implementation of a Play and Learn Web-Based Learning Platform for Aviation Information Management Students 
1. Introduction
   
Background of the Study
  
Traditional study methods, which can feel like simply reading dry material, often present challenges. Many students studying on their own find it particularly difficult to learn at their own pace. In response to these challenges, the use of digital technologies in education has significantly expanded in recent years. Web-based learning platforms, interactive tools, and educational games are transforming how students experience learning. These tools make education more dynamic by incorporating elements of interactivity, immediate feedback, and flexible access to content, thereby encouraging deeper engagement and better understanding of the material (du Plooy, Casteleijn, & Franzsen, 2024).
Web-based learning platforms, in particular, have emerged as effective tools for increasing student motivation and participation in educational settings. By providing flexible access to learning materials through the internet, these platforms allow students to study at their own pace and on their preferred devices. They support independent learning, accommodate different learning styles, and often include interactive features such as quizzes, progress tracking, and multimedia content. This accessibility and adaptability help maintain student engagement and improve the overall effectiveness of the learning process.
This system is only for enrolled students in the Aviation Information Management (AIM) course at the Philippine State College of Aeronautics. The goal is to make learning more interesting and enjoyable, which can help reduce stress and make studying more effective (Norabuena-Figueroa et al., 2025). By combining play and learning, this website aims to be easily available everywhere, allowing students to engage with course material in a fun and helpful way.

Problem Statement

Studying specialized subjects like Aviation Information Management (AIM), and keeping students actively involved can be challenging with only traditional studying methods. Students in this course at the Philippine State College of Aeronautics learn many difficult topics. The usual ways of self-studying might not always make the learning process fun or interactive enough to learn this material effectively. This can lead to students feeling less interested, struggling to fully grasp important ideas, and experiencing stress related to the demands of the course. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative way to make learning Aviation Information Management more engaging, less stressful, and more effective through interactive means like a website incorporating play and learning at their own pace.

Scope and Limitations

The system focuses on documenting the development of a Play and Learn website learning platform for students enrolled in the Aviation Information Management course. The platform will contain modules, quizzes, and games quizzes directly related to the Aviation Information Management course content. The system does have limitations. It does not view grades computation, or other academics  like evaluation or clearance. The project does not cover other courses, departments, or content outside this study. These are for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the course Aviation Information Management and Aviation System Requirements Analysis, Design & Quality Assurance course of the Institute of Computer Studies at Philippine State College of Aeronautics. This ensures that the system remains manageable and relevant to the learning needs of this particular student and curriculum. 



2. Review of Related Literature and Studies
   
Related Theories and Concepts

Interactive features are especially valuable in web-based learning platforms. On our platform, we enhance plain PDF files by adding quizzes, and interactive notes, transforming them into engaging learning resources. As a result, this approach makes learning more interesting and effective. According to Kitaboo (2024), reports on interactive digital tools such as interactive eBooks and e-learning materials show that most users prefer interactive content because it is more engaging and helps improve information retention compared to static text. This further supports the idea that students learn better through active participation. By integrating these interactive elements into PDFs,  the platform creates a more dynamic and impactful learning experience. Additionally, educators can use the data collected from these interactive elements to have better understanding of the student progress and to enhance their teaching styles according to the results accumulated. It also closes the gap between traditional documents and interactive learning by making it more accessible, engaging and effective for students.
Moreover, to enhance student engagement and make learning more enjoyable, incorporating Gamification Mechanics into the web platform’s design is a key strategy. This involves applying game-like elements in a non-game context to enrich the learning experience. As Ramírez Ruiz (2024) stated, "Gamification is presented as an innovative strategy in the field of education because using game design elements can engage students in the learning process.” Specifically, includes features such as points for completing modules, badges for achievements in quizzes or games, and potentially leaderboards. The platform’s architecture must be capable of tracking these elements and presenting them in a way that motivates continuous participation and active learning from the students. For instance, earning badges for having a mastery in specific topics can ignite a sense of accomplishment that can result in positive learning behaviors that can be used when it comes to collaboration in academic engagement. In particular, gamification has been shown to support peer collaboration and improve the overall learning environment for students. Understanding how gamified collaborative environments work is important, as they help students build key skills like organization, problem-solving, and self-confidence. It's essential to consider not only motivation and participation but also other factors such as self-confidence and emotional involvement. By doing so, educators can create more inclusive and effective learning environments for students.
In addition, to individual learning speeds and improved study effectiveness, the platform’s design will incorporate principles of Personalized or Adaptive Content Delivery. This is often enabled by recommender systems or similar logic within the platform’s architecture. Recommender systems (RS) can provide a personalized/adaptive learning environment and suggest appropriate MOOC resources to the learner. RS in MOOC delivers personalized recommendations for learning resources, based on learner interest (Uddin et al. 2021). The platform may not implement a full-scale recommender system, it will still be designed to deliver content such as modules, quizzes, or game difficulty levels quizzes in ways that can adjust to a student’s progress or preferences. Consequently, This approach supports personalized learning paths, helping students learn at their own pace and better understand complex aviation-related content.

Review of Existing Systems

Web-based learning includes different models that can guide the development of the proposed platform for the system. One example is Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), such as those offered by Coursera and edX. These platforms have made higher education more accessible by offering free or affordable courses from universities and professionals. Courses are usually divided into modules with video lessons, readings, and assessments, and they are used by millions of learners worldwide (Research.com, 2025). Although MOOCs offer flexible access to many subjects, research shows that learners may face challenges with motivation and focus due to the large and less personalized nature of these platforms (Kerman et al., 2021). However, the structured, modular format used by platforms like Coursera provides a helpful example for organizing complex topics like Aviation Information Management. This format allows learners to master foundational topics before progressing to more advanced concepts. By adapting this approach, the proposed platform can ensure that learners progress through defined learning paths with achievable goals and periodic assessments.
Another well-known model is gamified learning, with Duolingo being a popular example in language education. Duolingo uses game-like features such as points, streaks, badges, and interactive tasks to make learning more enjoyable and to encourage regular practice. These features tap into learners’ natural desire for achievement, competition, and progress, helping to keep them motivated over time. By turning lessons into short and engaging challenges, Duolingo makes learning feel more like playing a game than attending a traditional class. Use of gamification to make learning more interactive and rewarding is a key part of the "Play and Learn" approach for the proposed platform. It aims to make technical aviation topics easier to understand and more engaging for students. 
Furthermore, platforms like Khan Academy have demonstrated the effectiveness of providing free, accessible instructional videos and interactive exercises, particularly for foundational subjects. The way Khan Academy breaks down complex topics into understandable segments and offers tools for teachers to track progress provides a useful parallel for how the web-based learning platform can facilitate student understanding of intricate concepts and allow instructors to monitor learning outcomes. According to Karimov et al., (2023), Khan Academy’s model emphasizes self-paced learning, mastery of concepts through practice, and immediate feedback, which research suggests can enhance student performance and independent learning. By allowing students to learn at their own pace, it provides constant opportunities for self-assessment and ensures that no learner is left behind.
Gap Analysis


Well-known web-based learning platforms offer many advantages, however,  they have gaps and limitations that may not meet the specific needs of AIM students. MOOC platforms like Coursera and edX provide structured, high-quality content, but they are generally designed for broad subjects and not for the specialized and technical focus like in Aviation Information Management. Online content often lacks the interactive features and gamified learning strategies needed to effectively teach complex aviation topics (Infopro Learning, 2023). In fact, recent studies on learning management systems in aviation education highlight a lack of instructional methods tailored for competency-based learning in aeronautical courses (Impas et al., 2025).
Similarly, while Duolingo uses gamification successfully in language learning, its format cannot be directly applied to the course without major changes. The game mechanics and content would need to be redesigned to suit the technical and procedural nature of the topics. The platform addresses this gap by creating Play and Learn web-based experiences that are specifically designed for aviation-related modules.
In the same way, although Khan Academy offers strong interactive and self-paced learning tools, its content does not cover specialized vocational areas. Many large platforms take a “one-size-fits-all” approach, which does not effectively meet the unique challenges faced by students (Norabuena-Figueroa et al., 2025). For these reasons, the system web-based learning platform for the course is being developed to fill this important gap by offering a tailored, interactive, and gamified environment. It aims to turn standard materials such as PDFs into engaging quizzes.
